This is a tree for a great logger library [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) by Jake Wharton.

**Pine** is extension for default Timber DebugTree that logs class, method, and line number where it was invoked to help the developer locate log source easily.

Just like Jake Wharton I was tired of copying this one class to every single project, so I made it a library.

##Basic usage
----------------------
Pine is `Timber.Tree` implementation. Just plant it to Timber.

```java
Timber.plant(Pine.growDefault());
```
Default implementation tags logs with package name for class that called `Timber`. See section [Log format](#log-format) for more information.

##Replacing package names
----------------------
If you are tired of seeing full package of your app in every log, you can easy replace it with short word. Use `Pine.Builder`.

```java
Pine pineWithReplace = new Pine.Builder()
                .addPackageReplacePattern(getPackageName(), "PINE")
                .addPackageReplacePattern("com.github.simonpercic.oklog", "OKLOG")
                .grow();

// plant a pine at the beginning of application lifecycle
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {
    Timber.plant(pineWithReplace);
}
```

Your logs will start looking like this:
```
D/PINE.tls.dvncd.hlprs: MainActivity, lambda$onCreate$0, 51 ---> Debug message
```
Instead of this
```
D/cm.gthb.bskrs.smpl.tls.dvncd.hlprs: MainActivity, lambda$onCreate$0, 51 ---> Debug message
```

You can replace as many packages as you like. Or you can provide different phrases for different submodules of your app.

##Advanced usage
----------------------

If you like you can override default tag and message formatting using `setTagFormatter` and `setMessageFormatter` in `Pine.Builder` class. To format your tag or message you can use all the info available in `LogInfo` class.
Example of custom Pine planted in application class:

```java
Pine customPine = new Pine.Builder()
                .addPackageReplacePattern(getPackageName(), "PINE")
                .setTagFormatter(LogInfo::packageName)
                .setMessageFormatter(info -> {
                    return String.format(Locale.getDefault(), "%s#%s, %d ----> %s", info.className(),
                                         info.methodName(), info.lineNumber(), info.message());
                })
                .grow();
```

##Installation
----------------------

Available from jCenter.

Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.bskierys.pine:pine:0.2.0'
}
```

##Log format

**Pine** logs consists of two sections. 

 * **TAG**: is basically a package of class that invoked Timber. It is however formatted to reduce tag length (see [this stackoverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28168622/the-logging-tag-can-be-at-most-23-characters). Your main package is replaced by tag of your choosing, and the rest of package is stripped out of vowels. 
 * **Body**: is not only a message. It is also name of the class, of the method and line number where log was invoked. Very handy when you have pretty heavy logged classes.
 
**Example log:**
```
D/PINE.tls.dvncd.hlprs: MainActivity, lambda$onCreate$0, 51 ---> Debug message
```
This means your log was invoked in `com.github.bskierys.pine.utis.advancedHelpers.MainActivity#onCreate` method (line 51). My package `com.github.bskierys.pine` was replaced with `PINE`.
See sample app for more examples.
