This is a tree for a great logger library [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) by Jake Wharton.

**Pine** is extension for default DebugTree. It automatically logs class, method, and line number where it was invoked. It also has package-driven tagging which works nice with MVP project structure.

Just like Jake Wharton I was tired of copying this one class to every single project, so I made it a library.

##Usage
----------------------
Pine is `Timber.Tree` implementation. Just plant it to Timber.

```java
Timber.plant(new Pine(application, "appTag"));
```
Pine is using `Context` and `appTag` to build default log tag. Your tags will always start with `appTag`. See section [Log format](#log-format) for more information.

##Installation
----

Available from jCenter.

Gradle:

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.bskierys.pine:pine:0.1.0'
}
```

##Log format

**Pine** logs consists of two sections. 

 * **TAG**: is basically a package of class that invoked Timber. It is however formatted to reduce tag length (see [this stackoverflow thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28168622/the-logging-tag-can-be-at-most-23-characters). Your main package is replaced by tag of your choosing, and the rest of package is stripped out of vowels. 
 * **Body**: is not only a message. It is also name of the class, of the method and line number where log was invoked. Very handy when you have pretty heavy logged classes.
 
**Example log:**
```
D/pine.tls.dvncd.hlprs: MainActivity, lambda$onCreate$0, 51 ---> Debug message
```
This means your log was invoked in `com.github.bskierys.pine.utis.advancedHelpers.MainActivity#onCreate` method (line 51). My package `com.github.bskierys.pine` was replaced with `pine`.
See sample app for more examples.
